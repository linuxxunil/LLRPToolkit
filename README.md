We modify LTKCPP what can compile to arm architecure.
So, If you want to recompile the source , you must change the files,
  * LTKCPP/Library/Makefile
  * LTKCPP/Library/LLRP.org/Makefile
  * LTKCPP/Test/Makefile
  * LTKCPP/Examples/Makefile

Ref : The source forks from LLRPToolkit CVS. see http://llrp.org/
